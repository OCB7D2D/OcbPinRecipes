# OCB Pin Recipes Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

A small harmony mod enabling to pin recipes on the UI.

Needs to be installed client and server side. And both need
EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) to be turned off! There is no server-side
only version of this mod as it contains custom code. The mod
must also be installed on dedicated servers if you want to
use it in that setup, to persist pinned recipes for users.

Tip: Set your UI foreground opacity in video settings to 95%.
Otherwise all foreground items are forced to be fully opaque.

The craft & clear button is still a bit experimental, as
I had to copy a bit more code than wanted in order to do
all the necessary checks. So there is a chance that I
missed a few edge cases in that regard. Please report
here on GitHub if you find any issues with it.
