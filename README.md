# OCB Advanced Pin Recipes Mod - 7 Days to Die (V1.0) Addon

A small harmony mod enabling to pin recipes on the UI.

Needs to be installed client and server side. And both need
EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) to be turned off! There is no server-side
only version of this mod as it contains custom code. The mod
must also be installed on dedicated servers if you want to
use it in that setup, to persist pinned recipes for users.

Tip: Set your UI foreground opacity in video settings to 95%.
Otherwise all foreground items are forced to be fully opaque.

The craft & clear button is still a bit experimental, as
I had to copy a bit more code than wanted in order to do
all the necessary checks. So there is a chance that I
missed a few edge cases in that regard. Please report
here on GitHub if you find any issues with it.

## Feature overview

- Pin Multiple Recipes on to the side of your HUD.
- Use scroll wheel on pins to change queued amount.
- Use hammer icon to build recipe in open workstation/backpack.
- Double click on ingredients in the pins to queue them up too.
- Press "Alt" and use scroll wheel to select alternative recipes.
- Press "Alt+Shift" and scroll, to select quality (if applicable).
- Press "Shift" and click "+/-" or scroll for 10x inc-/decrement.
- Use "G" Hot-Key to grab required ingredients from open chests.
- Note: default "G" key-binding can be disabled/changed in xml.

## Grab ingredients QOL feature

With version 0.6.0 I've added another Quality of Life feature.
Loot containers (e.g. your own storage chests) and vehicle
containers get an additional button next to the "sort container"
button. When you press this "grab ingredient" button, it will try
to load as many items from the container as the pinned recipes
require. For even more convenience, this action is also available
by pressing `G` while the container is open. This key-binding
can be adjusted (or removed) in the XML config if required.

Currently the same button is also shown as a hand above the
pinned recipes. This is mostly to make users aware of this
feature and might be removed in the future. It may also be
helpful if your UI overwrites the item stack controller.
